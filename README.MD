Buff or Debuff is a single player card game against 3 other Computer Opponents.

The card deck consists of 24 cards that uniquely consists of 3 Tokens (X, O, ^) and have a numeric value (1-8).

Each player will be dealt 6 cards and each round will have a randomly selected Token that will "buff" a player's card's numeric value and a randomly selected token that will "debuff" the round's winning player's score. 

Buff will add 2 to a player's card's numeric value.

Debuff will remove 2 from the winning player's score. If the winning player plays a debuff card that card will not affect their score.

The player who plays the card with the highest numeric value wins the round. The player who won will have their score increase by their card's numeric value.
